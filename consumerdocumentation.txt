Connection and Configuration:

The code ensures that the consumer configuration is properly initialized once.
PostgreSQL table creation is made conditional (IF NOT EXISTS) to avoid errors on repeated runs.

Function insert_data:

Documented the function to clarify its purpose.
Moved the function definition above the consumer loop for better readability.

Consumer Loop:

The loop correctly polls Kafka messages, processes them, and decodes them.
Error handling checks for errors in Kafka messages.
The insert_data function is called with the decoded message.

Clean Up:

Proper closing of the Kafka consumer and PostgreSQL connections is ensured.

Explanation:
The script subscribes to a Kafka topic (topic_0) and continuously polls for messages.
When a message is received, it is decoded and processed.
The data is inserted into a PostgreSQL database hosted on Aiven.
